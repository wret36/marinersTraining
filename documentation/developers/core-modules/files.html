<h2>Files Module</h2>


<h2>Overview</h2>
		
<p>
	The files module is an excellent way for the site admin to manage the files in use on the
	site. All images or files that are inserted into pages or blog posts are stored here. You may upload
	them directly from the WYSIWYG editor or you can upload them here and just insert them via WYSIWYG.
</p>


<h6>Managing Folders</h6>

<p>
	After you create the top level folder or folders you may create as many subfolders as you need such as blog/images/screenshots/image.jpg
	and pages/audio/sample.mp3. The folder names are for your use only, the name is not displayed in the download link on the front end.
	To manage folders select Manage Folders in the left column, then click Edit on the folder you wish to change.
</p>


		<h6>Managing Files</h6>

<p>
	To upload or manage files select the folder name in the left column. If the file is in a subfolder just choose the parent. Once you are
	in the parent folder you can choose the subfolder and filter by file type with the dropdowns at the top of the screen.
