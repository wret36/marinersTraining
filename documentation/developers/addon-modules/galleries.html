<h2>Galleries Module</h2>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The galleries module is a basic photo management tool. Features include drag & drop sorting, a crop tool, and sub galleries.</p>
		
<h2>Creating Galleries</h2>

<p>Click "Create a new Gallery" in the shortcut menu. Fill out the title, slug, and the (optional) Description. (The Description shows
	beside the gallery thumbnail at http://example.com/galleries). Choose whether you want to enable comments for this gallery or not
	and select Publish if you wish for the gallery to show in the list of galleries. Note: selecting Unpublish does not disable the gallery, it just
	removes it from the list at http://example.com/galleries. You can still create a navigation link directly to it and the
	gallery will be viewable. For example: http://example.com/galleries/gallery-title
</p>

<h2>Uploading Images</h2>

<p>After saving the gallery select the Upload button to upload images. Fill out the title, select an image, choose which gallery to upload to, and
	fill in an (optional) caption. If the upload is not successful check your image size. Many hosts do not allow file uploads over 2MB. Many modern cameras
	produce images in exess of 5MB. To remedy this limitation you may either ask your host to change the upload limit or you may wish to
	resize your images before uploading. Resizing has the added advantage of faster upload times.
</p>

<h2>Manage Gallery</h2>

<p>Click on List Galleries->Manage. Here you may change the gallery's title, slug, description, etc. If you want a thumbnail to represent this
	gallery in the gallery list you may choose one from the dropdown. To change the order that the images are displayed in on the front-end
	simply grab the images and drag them into the proper order.
</p>

<h2>Editing an Image</h2>

<p>From the Manage page click on the image that you would like to edit. From the edit page you may change all of the image's info or crop the image.
	To crop simply click the Crop button, draw a box with your mouse where you would like the crop to be, close the modal window, and click Save. To
	delete the image check the Delete checkbox and click Save.
